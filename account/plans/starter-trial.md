Market Data is excited to offer a **30-day free trial** of our Starter Plan, no credit card required. This trial is designed to let users explore the capabilities of the Starter Plan, ensuring it's the right fit for their needs before committing to a subscription. Here's what you need to know about the Starter Trial Plan.

## What You Get with the Starter Trial Plan

- **10,000 API Credits per Day**: Experience the increased capacity for API requests and see how it supports larger projects.
- **Delayed Data**: Access to data from our cache that is typically delayed by 15-30 minutes, provided on a "best effort" basis, meaning delays can vary.
- **1 Year Of Historical Data Access**: Explore our extensive historical data archives and fetch data from the last year.
- **Full Historical Data Access (AAPL Ticker)**: Fetch complete historical data from our extensive archives for the AAPL ticker with no date restrictions.
- **Premium Endpoints (AAPL Ticker)**: Explore our premium endpoints using the AAPL ticker, including fundamental data like earnings.

## Features of the Starter Trial Plan

The Starter Trial Plan mirrors the full Starter Plan in terms of features, with a few key differences:

- **Duration**: The trial lasts for 30 days, giving you ample time to test out the features and decide if the plan meets your needs.
- **No Credit Card Required**: Start your trial without any financial commitment, allowing you to explore our services risk-free.
- **Full Access with Limitations**: While you have access to most of the same features as the paid Starter Plan, remember that the trial is designed for evaluation purposes. It is not a full substitute of the actual Starter Plan.

## What You Don't Get With the Starter Trial

- **Historical Data Access (All Tickers)**: Historical data access on tickers other than AAPL is limited to 1 year.
- **Premium Endpoints (All Tickers)**: Get full access to our premium endpoints with all tickers.
