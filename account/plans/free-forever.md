The **Free Forever Plan** is designed for users who want to explore Market Data's capabilities without any cost. It's perfect for individuals or small projects needing basic access to financial data. Here's everything you need to know about what the Free Forever plan offers and its limitations.

## What You Get with Free Forever

- **100 API Credits per Day**: Ideal for small-scale applications or personal projects.
- **Delayed Data**: Access to data that is usually delayed by at least 15 minutes. We strive to provide this data on a "best effort" basis, meaning delays can vary.
- **Standard Endpoints**: Use most of our standard endpoints that offer pricing information, allowing you to integrate financial data into your applications.
- **1 Year of Historical Data**: Explore and utilize historical data up to one year back for your analysis and projects.

## Limitations of the Free Forever Plan

While the Free Forever plan offers a great starting point, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **No Real-Time Data**: Access to real-time financial data is not available under this plan.
- **No Premium Endpoints**: Fundamental data, such as earnings data provided through our premium endpoints, are not accessible.
- **Historical Data Limited to 1 Year**: If your project requires data older than one year, you would need to consider upgrading to a paid subscription.
