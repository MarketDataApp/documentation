## Current Status

At the moment, Market Data's customer dashboard is unavailable due to an issue with a third-party customer management provider. As a result, dashboard logins and new account creation are temporarily not working.

## API Services Unaffected

Importantly, this issue does not affect our API. All existing API tokens, integrations, and Google Sheets formulas continue to operate normally, and market data delivery is unaffected.

## Resolution Timeline

We are actively working with the provider to resolve the issue. While the timeline depends on the third party, we currently expect login access to be restored within the next day or two. We will provide updates as soon as more information becomes available.

## Getting Help

If you need help with anything in the meantime — including account details, billing questions, or access-related concerns — please reply to your support email or contact us directly, and we'll assist you.

Thank you for your patience and understanding while we work to restore full access.
