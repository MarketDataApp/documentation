At Market Data, we strive to make your experience with our services as seamless and positive as possible. When you decide to upgrade your plan, we ensure that your unused time is not wasted. The method we use to calculate your savings is the same, but the way you receive the credit is slightly different depending on whether you're moving from a monthly plan to an annual plan or from an annual plan to a monthly plan. Here's how we calculate and apply your unused time towards your new plan:

## Switching from a Monthly Plan to an Annual Plan

If you decide to upgrade before your current monthly subscription period ends, we calculate the credit from the unused portion of your monthly plan. This credit is then applied as a discount on the upfront cost of your new annual plan.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Calculate unused days**: We start by figuring out how many days remain in your current monthly subscription.
2. **Determine the daily rate**: We calculate the daily rate of your monthly plan by dividing the total cost by 30 (average number of days per month).
3. **Calculate your credit**: We multiply the number of unused days by the daily rate to find out how much credit you have.
4. **Apply this credit**: This amount is then discounted from the price of your new annual plan.

### Examples

Let's look at two specific examples to understand how the discounts are calculated and applied when upgrading to an annual plan:

#### Example 1: From Monthly Starter Plan to Annual Starter Plan

- **Original Plan**: Monthly Starter Plan costing $30/month.
- **New Plan**: Annual Starter Plan costing $108/year.

**Scenario**: Suppose you are halfway through your monthly cycle when you decide to upgrade.

- **Unused Time Calculation**: 15 days remaining in the month.
- **Daily Rate**: $30 / 30 = $1 per day.
- **Credit Amount**: 15 days x $1/day = $15.
- **Discount Applied**: Your new annual plan will be discounted by $15, so you pay $108 - $15 = $93 initially.

#### Example 2: From Monthly Trader Plan to Annual Trader Plan

- **Original Plan**: Monthly Trader Plan costing $100/month.
- **New Plan**: Annual Trader Plan costing $348/year.

**Scenario**: Suppose you decide to upgrade with 10 days left in your monthly plan.

- **Unused Time Calculation**: 10 days remaining.
- **Daily Rate**: $100 / 30 = ~$3.33 per day.
- **Credit Amount**: 10 days x $3.33/day = ~$33.30.
- **Discount Applied**: Your new annual plan will be discounted by $33.30, so you pay $348 - $33.30 = $314.70 initially.

## Switching from an Annual Plan to a Monthly Plan

When you upgrade to a different plan before your current annual subscription expires, we calculate the credit you will receive based on the percentage of unused days remaining in your subscription. This credit is then applied to extend the renewal date of your new, upgraded plan.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the unused days**: First, we count how many days are left until your current plan was set to expire.
2. **Calculate the percentage of the year left**: We calculate what percentage of the year remains from the moment you upgrade.
3. **Determine the credit**: We apply this percentage to the cost of your annual plan to figure out your credit amount.
4. **Apply the credit to your new plan**: This credit is then used to extend the renewal date of your newly purchased monthly plan.

### Examples

To give you a clearer picture, here are two examples of how the credit is calculated and applied:

#### Example 1: Upgrading from Annual Trader Plan to Prime Plan

- **Original Plan**: Annual Trader Plan costing $348/year.
- **New Plan**: Prime Plan costing $250/month ($8.33 per day)

**Scenario**: Suppose you decide to upgrade with 90 days left in your subscription year.

- **Unused Time Calculation**: 90 days / 365 days = ~24.7% of the year left.
- **Credit Amount**: 24.7% of $348 = $85.96.
- **Application of Credit**: This $85.96 will be credited to your new Prime plan, extending the renewal date by 11 days.

#### Example 2: Upgrading from Annual Starter Plan to Prime Plan

- **Original Plan**: Annual Starter Plan costing $108/year.
- **New Plan**: Prime Plan costing $250/month. ($8.33 per day)

**Scenario**: Suppose you decide to upgrade with 200 days left in your subscription year.

- **Unused Time Calculation**: 200 days / 365 days = ~54.8% of the year left.
- **Credit Amount**: 54.8% of $108 = $59.18.
- **Application of Credit**: This $59.18 will be credited to your new Prime plan, extending the renewal date by 8 days.
