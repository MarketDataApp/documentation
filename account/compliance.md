Exchange regulations require us to collect a broad range of information from all users for the purpose of account verification and compliance. Market Data is committed to protecting your privacy and will only use this information to verify your account and comply with these exchange regulations.

Please be aware that we are required to share this information with the exchanges, and they regularly review this information for accuracy.

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

We understand that providing personal information can feel intrusive, and we want to assure you that we take your privacy seriously. The information we collect is strictly for compliance with exchange regulations. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

We are committed to using your information responsibly and only for the purposes outlined in this document. We do not sell or share your information with third parties beyond what is required by the exchanges.

## Information We Collect

## Verification Process

On sign-up, we will review your account profile and verify the information you provided to us matches third-party databases such as LinkedIn. We will also review FINRA BrokerCheck to determine if you hold any active securities licenses. The goal of this process is to classify your data use as either a professional or non-professional data user.

Profiles that are missing contact or employer information will not be classified until all the information is provided. By providing _all required information_, you allow us to complete the verification process quickly and fully activate your account. Until the verification process is complete, your account cannot be activated for real-time data.

### Missing or Mismatching Information

We cannot activate your service if your account profile contains missing, incomplete, or mismatched information. All fields are required, and they must match third-party databases.

### Verification Timeframe

We will review your account profile and verify the information you provided to us within 1 business day of you providing the information. If there are any delays, we will notify you promptly.

### Verification Documents

If a customer's account profile contains missing or mismatched information, we will request additional documents to verify the information.

## Annual Review

Once per year, we will ask you to review your account profile and verify that the information is still correct. You can do this by logging into your account and clicking the pop-up dialog that will appear after one year has passed since your last verification.

If nothing has changed, you can click the button to confirm that the information is still correct. If something has changed, simply update the information and click the submit button to confirm the changes.
