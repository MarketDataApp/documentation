Exchange regulations require us to collect a broad range of information from all users for the purpose of account verification and compliance. Market Data is committed to protecting your privacy and will only use this information to verify your account and comply with these exchange regulations.

Please be aware that we are required to share this information with the exchanges, and they regularly review this information for accuracy.

## Information We Collect

Customers employed by banks, insurance companies, or other financial institutions are required to undergo a more thorough review process.

## Verification Process

On sign-up, we will review your account profile and verify the information you provided to us matches third-party databases such as LinkedIn. We will review FINRA BrokerCheck to determine if you hold any active licenses.

### Missing or Mismatching Information

We cannot activate your service if your account profile contains missing, incomplete, or mismatched information. All fields are required, and they must match third-party databases.

### Verification Timeframe

We will review your account profile and verify the information you provided to us within 1 business day of you providing the information. If there are any delays, we will notify you promptly.

### Verification Documents

If a customer's account profile contains missing or mismatched information, we will request additional documents to verify the information.

## Annual Review

Once per year, we will ask you to review your account profile and verify that the information is still correct. You can do this by logging into your account and clicking the pop-up dialog that will appear after one year has passed since your last verification.

If nothing has changed, you can click the button to confirm that the information is still correct. If something has changed, simply update the information and click the submit button to confirm the changes.
