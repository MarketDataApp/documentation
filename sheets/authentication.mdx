Market Data's Sheets Add-on uses **automatic Google Authentication** to authorize requests to Market Data's servers. This means that once you login to Sheets using your Google account, the Market Data Add-on will automatically link to your Market Data account _as long as you signed-up for a Market Data account using the same Google e-mail address_.

:::warning
If you signed-up to Market Data using an e-mail address that is different from the e-mail address you use to login to Google, you will need to change your Market Data account e-mail address to the same e-mail address you use to login to Google Sheets.
