=STOCKDATA("AAPL,MSFT,TSLA", "all")
=STOCKDATA(A1:A500, "bid,ask,last")
```

## Sample Usage For Candles
```excel-formula
=STOCKDATA("AAPL", "close", "1/1/2021", "1/31/2021", "hourly")
=STOCKDATA("AAPL", "all", TODAY()-30, 30)
```
### Bulk Candles
```excel-formula
=STOCKDATA("AAPL,MSFT,TSLA", "all", "today")
=STOCKDATA("AAPL,MSFT,TSLA", "all", "12/20/2023")
=STOCKDATA(A1:A3, "all", "12/20/2023")
```
## Syntax
```excel-formula
=STOCKDATA(symbols, [historial attributes|quote attributes], start date, end date, resolution)

## Price vs Close vs Last vs Mid

When you are looking for a single price for a stock, depending on what data you would like the `STOCKDATA` formula to return during the extended session (or when the market is closed), it may make sense to use the "close", "last", or "mid" attributes instead of STOCKDATA's default "price" attribute.

| Function Call                     | During The Regular Session               | During The Extended Session              | Market Closed, Holidays, etc.                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `=STOCKDATA("AAPL")`              | Midpoint bid/ask of the regular session  | Midpoint bid/ask of the extended session | Closing price of the previous regular session |
| `=STOCKDATA("AAPL", "PRICE")`     | Midpoint bid/ask of the regular session  | Midpoint bid/ask of the extended session | Closing price of the previous regular session |
| `=STOCKDATA("AAPL", "CLOSE")`     | Last trade of the regular session        | Closing price of the previous session    | Closing price of the previous regular session |
| `=STOCKDATA("AAPL", "LAST")`      | Last trade of the regular session        | Last trade of the extended session       | Last trade of the previous extended session   |
| `=STOCKDATA("AAPL", "MID")`       | Midpoint bid/ask of the regular session  | Midpoint bid/ask of the extended session | No data                                       |

## Notes
- All parameters must be enclosed in quotation marks or be references to cells containing text. A possible exception is when endDate is specified as a number of days.
- Results with a single data point will be returned as a value within a single cell. Multiple data points will be returned as an expanded array with column headers.
- If any date parameters are specified, the request is considered historical and only the historical attributes are allowed.
- Dates and times are returned in the same timezone of the exchange.
- When writing bulk candles formulas, only a single date is allowed. Date ranges are not permitted. Only daily candles are supported for bulk candles.
