It is possible to share you sheet with other users by using the **Share** button in the top right corner of the sheet. You can share the sheet with anyone who has a Google account. The only two requirements are that each user who receives a copy of your sheet must have the [Market Data Add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/market_data/453586334945) installed from the Google Workspace Marketplace and have a Market Data account.

:::warning
If you share your sheet with a user who does not have a Market Data account, they will not be able to execute the formulas in the sheet. They will receive an error message and the Market Data formulas will not execute.

## Sharing Mode

You must share your sheet in **Edit** mode to allow a user to open the sidebar and execute the formulas. If you share your sheet in **View** or **Comment** mode, the Market Data formulas will not execute because the user will not have access to the sidebar.

## Sharing with Market Data Free or Trial Users

You can share your sheet with Market Data free or trial users but these users will not have access to real-time data. They will only have access to delayed and historical data. If you need to share your sheet with another user who needs real-time data, each user will need to have a paid Market Data account.
