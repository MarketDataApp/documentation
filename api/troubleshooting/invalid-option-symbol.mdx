title: 400: Invalid Option Symbol
sidebar_position: 12

A `400 BAD REQUEST` with this message:

```json
{
  "s": "error",
  "errmsg": "Invalid option symbol. Use valid OCC symbology for the option symbol."
}
```

means the **request format can be valid**, but the `optionSymbol` value itself is malformed.

## Why This Is a 400

We treat an invalid OCC option symbol as invalid input. Even if your endpoint and query parameters are otherwise correct, an invalid `optionSymbol` is a bad request.

This should be treated as a client-side construction bug. Your code should not emit malformed OCC symbols.

## Fast Fix

Use valid OCC option symbology:

`UNDERLYING + YYMMDD + C/P + 8-digit strike`

Example:

- `AAPL251219C00150000`

## Common Construction Errors

1. Wrong expiration encoding (not `YYMMDD`)
2. Missing call/put flag (`C` or `P`)
3. Strike field not exactly 8 digits
4. Missing zero padding in strike field
5. Incorrect handling of cents in strike encoding
6. Using pre-2010 legacy option symbol format

## Historical Contracts Before 2010

Even for options that traded before the 2010 symbology change, requests must still use the **current OCC format** (post-2010 format).

Do not send legacy pre-2010 symbols.

## How To Validate Before Requesting Quotes

1. Build or validate the symbol with `options/lookup` first.
2. Use the returned OCC symbol in `options/quotes`.
3. If `options/lookup` fails, fix input before calling quote endpoints.

```http
# Generate a valid OCC symbol from human-readable input
GET https://api.marketdata.app/v1/options/lookup/AAPL%2012/19/2025%20150%20Call

# Then request quote with returned symbol
GET https://api.marketdata.app/v1/options/quotes/AAPL251219C00150000/
```

## 400 vs 404 (Important)

- `400` means the OCC symbol itself is malformed (invalid input).
- `404` means the OCC symbol format is valid, but no real contract/data exists for that strike and expiration.

Typical `404` response in this case:

```json
{
  "s": "error",
  "errmsg": "No option found. No option was found for this strike and expiration."
}
```

## If You Still Get 400

1. Log the exact `optionSymbol` sent to the API.
2. Compare it to the `optionSymbol` returned by `options/lookup`.
3. Verify no string transformations are altering the symbol in your client code.
