Market Data, as stated in our [terms of service](https://www.marketdata.app/terms/), makes no representation as to the reliability, availability, or timeliness of our service. **This is not just a standard disclaimer.** We have not yet been able to achieve 99.9% reliability, which is a metric we consider a minimum level of reliability that is needed to operate without a backup provider.

**Market Data is a low cost provider** and we have determined that cost, rather than reliability, is our key driver. While we hope to achieve 99.9% reliability in the future, our focus will remain on keeping down costs and avoiding price increases for our users.

:::tip Recommendation
We highly encourage users with mission critical applications to have a backup provider or utilize Market Data as their secondary provider.

## How To Confirm Downtime

Market Data provides real-time status monitoring for each of our API endpoints. You can check the status of individual endpoints either through our status webpage or programmatically via our status API endpoint.

### Status Webpage

Visit our [status page](https://www.marketdata.app/status/) to view the current status of all Market Data API endpoints, including historical uptime statistics.

- Status Page: [https://www.marketdata.app/status/](https://www.marketdata.app/status/)

### Confirm Downtime Programmatically

Use the [/utilities/status/ endpoint](/api/utilities/status) to programmatically check the status of all Market Data API endpoints. This endpoint returns the current status for each endpoint (e.g., `/v1/stocks/quotes/`, `/v1/options/chain/`, etc.) and will remain online during outages, allowing you to determine which specific endpoints are affected.

:::tip
This endpoint is ideal to allow for automatic switching between Market Data and your backup provider when specific endpoints are down.

## What To Do During Downtime

It is not necessary to advise us of downtime or service outages. We monitor the status of our systems and we investigate and respond to all service outages. During Market Data service outages, we encourage you to switch your systems over to your back-up provider until our systems come back online.
