A `402 PAYMENT REQUIRED` means your request is valid, but your current plan does not include the specific data or feature you requested.

This is a **plan entitlement** issue, not an authentication issue and not a rate-limit issue.

## Fast Triage

You are likely hitting `402` when one of these is true:

1. You requested historical data older than your plan allows.
2. You requested a premium endpoint from Free/Trial.
3. You requested `mode=cached` from Free/Trial.

## What Triggers 402 by Plan

### Free Forever and Trial Plans

Common 402 causes:

1. Historical query older than 1 year.
2. Premium endpoint request.
3. `mode=cached` request.

### Starter Plan

Common 402 cause:

1. Historical query older than 5 years.

### Trader, Quant, Prime

Trader, Quant, and Prime should not receive `402 PAYMENT REQUIRED` for standard plan usage.

If you receive `402` on one of these plans, treat it as unexpected and contact support with the full request/response details.

## Historical Age Rules

- Free Forever and Trial plans: up to 1 year of historical data
- Starter: up to 5 years of historical data
- Trader/Quant/Prime: no historical age limit

## mode=cached Rule

`mode=cached` is a paid-plan feature.

- Free/Trial: `mode=cached` is not available and can produce `402`
- Paid plans: available on supported endpoints

For mode details, see [Data Mode](/api/universal-parameters/mode).

## Premium Endpoint Rule

Free/Trial plans can access standard pricing endpoints but not premium endpoint features. Premium endpoint requests from Free/Trial can produce `402`.

For plan-level capability details, see [Plan Limits](/account/plan-limits).

## 30-Second Fix Checklist

1. Confirm your current plan in the dashboard.
2. If historical request: reduce date range to your plan limit.
3. If using Free/Trial: remove `mode=cached`.
4. If using Free/Trial: switch from premium endpoint to standard endpoint (or upgrade).
5. Retry after adjusting request scope/feature usage.
