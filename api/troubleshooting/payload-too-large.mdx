title: 413: Payload Too Large
sidebar_position: 11
---

A `413 PAYLOAD TOO LARGE` means your request asked for more candle data than is allowed in a single call.

For candles, this is most commonly triggered on **intraday resolutions** when you request **more than 1 year** in one request.

## Fast Fix

For intraday candles, request less than 1 year per API call.

## Why This Happens

The candles endpoints enforce request-size constraints to keep responses bounded and reliable. If your intraday candle range is too large, the API returns `413`.

Daily candles are allowed beyond 1 year.

## What To Change

1. For intraday requests, reduce the date window to less than 1 year.
2. If you need more history, split your query into multiple requests.

## Example

```http
# Too large (intraday example)
GET https://api.marketdata.app/v1/stocks/candles/1/AAPL/?from=2022-01-01&to=2024-12-31

# Valid intraday: keep each request under 1 year
GET https://api.marketdata.app/v1/stocks/candles/1/AAPL/?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31

# Daily example: multi-year range is allowed
GET https://api.marketdata.app/v1/stocks/candles/D/AAPL/?from=2015-01-01&to=2024-12-31
```

## If You Still Get 413

1. Double-check `from`/`to` ranges after timezone normalization.
2. Verify your client is not expanding ranges unexpectedly.
3. Contact support with your full request URL and parameters.
