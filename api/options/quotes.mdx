</TabItem>
<TabItem value="NoData" label="No Data">

Returned when the request is valid, but **no quote data exists** for the requested symbol or time period.  
This response corresponds to an **HTTP 404 Not Found** status.

- **s** `string`  
  Will be `no_data`.

- **errmsg** `string`  
  A descriptive message explaining why no data is available.  
  For example:  
  - `"No option found. No option was found for this strike and expiration."`  
  This occurs when even though the option symbol format is valid, no real, tradable contract exists for the specified strike and expiration.

A `no_data` response may occur when:
- The market is closed (weekends or holidays)
- The symbol or option contract had no trading quotes on the requested date
- The contract had not begun trading yet
- No option exists for the requested strike and expiration

Even when the option symbol format is valid, the absence of a real, tradable contract or any quote data results in a `404` / `no_data` response.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Error" label="Error">

Returned when the request itself is invalid or cannot be processed.

- **s** `string`  
  Will be `error`.

  A human-readable description of the error.

These cases correspond to **HTTP 400 Bad Request**, such as:
- Invalid or malformed option symbol format
- Parameters that cannot be parsed
- Unsupported or invalid values

Use the HTTP status code—not just the `s` field—to distinguish between invalid input (`400`) and valid requests that simply have no data (`404` via `no_data`).
