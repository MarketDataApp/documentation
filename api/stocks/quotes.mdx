## Request Parameters

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="required" label="Required" default>

- **symbol** `string`

  The company's ticker symbol.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Optional" label="Optional">

- **52week** `boolean`

  Enable the output of 52-week high and 52-week low data in the quote output. By default this parameter is `false` if omitted.

- **extended** `boolean`

  Control the inclusion of extended hours data in the quote output. Defaults to `true` if omitted. 

  - When set to `true`, the most recent quote is always returned, without regard to whether the market is open for primary trading or extended hours trading.
  - When set to `false`, only quotes from the primary trading session are returned. When the market is closed or in extended hours, a historical quote from the last closing bell of the primary trading session is returned instead of an extended hours quote. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Response Attributes

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Success" label="Success" default>

- **s** `string`

  Will always be `ok` when there is data for the symbol requested.

- **symbol** `array[string]`

  The symbol of the stock.

- **ask** `array[number]`

  The ask price of the stock.

- **askSize** `array[number]`

  The number of shares offered at the ask price.

- **bid** `array[number]`

  The bid price.

- **bidSize** `array[number]`

  The number of shares that may be sold at the bid price.

- **mid** `array[number]`

  The midpoint price between the ask and the bid.

- **last** `array[number]`

  The last price the stock traded at.

:::note
  - When the market is open for primary trading, **change** and **changepct** are always calculated using the last traded price and the last primary session close. When the market is closed or in extended hours, this criteria is also used as long as `extended` is omitted or set to `true`.
  - When `extended` is set to `false`, and the market is closed or in extended hours, quotes from extended hours are not considered. The values for **change** and **changepct** will be calculated using the last two closing prices instead.
