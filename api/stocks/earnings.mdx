  :::tip

  GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings per share (EPS) count all financial activities except for discontinued operations and major changes in accounting methods. Non-GAAP EPS, on the other hand, typically doesn't include losses or devaluation of assets, and often leaves out irregular expenses like significant restructuring costs, large tax or legal charges, especially for companies not in the financial sector.

  The difference in percentage terms between the estimated EPS and the reported EPS, expressed as a decimal. For example, if the estimated EPS is 1.00 and the reported EPS is 1.20, the surpriseEPSpct would be 0.20 (or 20%).
