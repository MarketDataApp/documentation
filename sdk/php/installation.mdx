The Market Data PHP SDK can be installed via Composer, the standard PHP dependency manager.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer

## Installing with Composer

Install the SDK using Composer:

```bash
composer require marketdataapp/sdk-php
```

This will install the SDK and all required dependencies.

## Dependencies

The SDK depends on the following packages, which are automatically installed by Composer:

- **guzzlehttp/guzzle** - HTTP client for making API requests
- **vlucas/phpdotenv** - Environment variable loading from `.env` files
- **psr/log** - PSR-3 logger interface
- **nesbot/carbon** - Date/time handling
- **monolog/monolog** - PSR-3 compatible logging (optional)

## Verifying Installation

After installation, you can verify the SDK is working by creating a simple test script:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use MarketDataApp\Client;

// Create client (uses MARKETDATA_TOKEN environment variable)
$client = new Client();

// Test the connection
$status = $client->utilities->api_status();
echo "API Status Response: {$status->status}\n";

if (!empty($status->services)) {
    $service = $status->services[0];
    echo "Service Check: {$service->service} is {$service->status}\n";
}
```

## Updating the SDK

To update to the latest version:

```bash
composer update marketdataapp/sdk-php
```

## Next Steps

After installing the SDK, [set up your authentication token](/sdk/php/authentication) to start making API calls.
